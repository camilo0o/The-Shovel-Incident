## Base class for all hit-dealing areas — [HitBoxArea] extends this, and [ProjectileArea]
## extends [HitBoxArea]. Holds the [member attack_data] used to deal damage and stun.
##
## Always active Deals damage on every [HurtBoxArea] overlap and can hit the same
## target multiple times at once (e.g. standing + crouching hurtboxes), since there's 
## no exception check like [member AttackManager.hit_expetions] provides.[br]
## Useful on its own for quick testing without setting up a full [Attack].
