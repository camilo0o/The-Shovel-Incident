```
AttackManager
  Attack
	Frame
	  Hitbox and or Hurtbox and or sprites
		shapes
```
- attack data per hit box
- player input system with motion inputs 
- player movelist orginization
- sample char
- sample zonner char 
- some automatic sprite contol on the attacks 
- frame by frame mode for contol
- basic stun manager
- attack veloicy and posion animations
	player is animated by changing velcity and math is done to corect the values so the developer can set postion canges and contiol how fast the player moves form one posion to the other using curves to edit the motion
- a spawan scene object 
- primary hurt box secene
- the ablity to set a hit sound per attack 
- speical cancels system

- protection against hiting the same target more than once (porjectiles do not hit boxes do)
- protection from hiting self
